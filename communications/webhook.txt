ðŸŽ£ Webhook 

A webhook is an HTTP callback mechanism that allows one system to send real-time notifications or data to another system over the internet 

It enables event-driven communication between systems, where the source system pushes data to the destination system when certain events occur 

Webhooks are widely used for integrating different applications, services, or platforms 

ðŸŽ¯ Why and Where Webhooks are Used 

Real-time communication: Webhooks enable real-time data transfer between systems, eliminating the need for constant polling or long-polling 

Event-driven architecture: Webhooks allow systems to react to specific events or changes in data, triggering actions or updates in the receiving system 

Integration and synchronization: Webhooks facilitate seamless integration and synchronization of data between different applications or services 

ðŸ“® Webhook Components 

POST REST API: Webhooks typically use the HTTP POST method to send data to the specified URL endpoint 

Payload: The data sent in the webhook request, usually in JSON format, containing relevant information about the event or update 

Authorization: Webhooks may include authentication mechanisms, such as API keys or tokens, to ensure the receiving system can verify the authenticity of the request 

Secret Key: A shared secret key can be used to sign the webhook payload, allowing the receiving system to validate the integrity of the data 

ðŸ”„ Retry Mechanism 

In case of failures or unsuccessful webhook deliveries, a retry mechanism can be implemented to ensure reliable data delivery 

The sending system can keep track of failed webhook requests and retry sending them after a specified interval or exponential backoff 

Retry limits and timeouts can be set to prevent indefinite retries and handle persistent failures gracefully 

ðŸ”’ Verification 

To ensure the security and authenticity of webhook requests, the receiving system can implement verification mechanisms 

One common approach is to include a unique identifier or signature in the webhook payload, which the receiving system can validate against a pre-shared secret key 

The receiving system can also whitelist the IP addresses or domains of the sending system to prevent unauthorized requests 

ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases 

Notification Systems: Webhooks can be used to send real-time notifications or alerts to users or systems when specific events occur (e.g., new message, payment received) 

Data Synchronization: Webhooks enable real-time synchronization of data between different systems, keeping them up to date with the latest changes (e.g., syncing customer data between CRM and marketing automation platforms)
