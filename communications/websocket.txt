üåê WebSocket 

A protocol that enables full-duplex, bidirectional communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived TCP connection 

Allows real-time data transfer without the need for polling or long-polling techniques 

Provides a more efficient and low-latency alternative to traditional HTTP-based communication 

üîÑ Full-Duplex Communication 

WebSocket allows both the client and the server to send messages to each other independently and simultaneously 

The communication channel remains open and active, enabling real-time, two-way communication 

Eliminates the need for the client to continuously poll the server for updates or the server to hold open connections for each client 

üîí Single Long-Lived TCP Connection 

WebSocket uses a single, persistent TCP connection for the entire duration of the communication session 

The connection is established through an HTTP handshake, and then it is upgraded to a WebSocket connection 

All subsequent messages are sent over this single connection, reducing the overhead of creating new connections for each message 

üì® Message Transmission 

In WebSocket, every message is sent over the single, long-lived connection 

Messages can be sent from the client to the server or from the server to the client at any time 

The WebSocket protocol defines a specific message format that includes a small header and the message payload 

Messages can be text or binary data, allowing for flexible data exchange 

üîÑ 101 Switching Protocols 

During the initial handshake, the client sends an HTTP request with an Upgrade header, indicating the desire to switch to the WebSocket protocol 

If the server supports WebSocket, it responds with an HTTP status code of 101 (Switching Protocols) and completes the handshake 

The connection is then upgraded from HTTP to WebSocket, and further communication takes place using the WebSocket protocol

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges 

Resource Usage: WebSocket connections can consume more server resources compared to traditional HTTP connections, especially if there are a large number of connected clients 

Connection Limits: Servers may have limitations on the maximum number of concurrent WebSocket connections they can handle 

Sticky Sessions and Load Balancing: Ensuring that WebSocket connections are properly routed to the same server instance in a load-balanced environment can be challenging 

Authentication: Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms for WebSocket connections requires additional considerations and security measures 

Firewall and Proxy Compatibility: WebSocket traffic may be blocked or misinterpreted by some firewalls and proxies, requiring configuration or workarounds 

Scaling: Scaling WebSocket applications horizontally across multiple servers requires proper coordination and synchronization mechanisms 

Testing and Backward Compatibility: Testing WebSocket applications can be more complex, and ensuring backward compatibility with older clients or browsers may require fallback mechanisms 

Resource Cleanup: Properly cleaning up and closing WebSocket connections when they are no longer needed is important to prevent resource leaks and ensure efficient resource utilization
