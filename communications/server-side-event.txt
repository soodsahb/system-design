üì° Server-Sent Events (SSE) 

A technology that allows a server to send data to a client over a single, long-lived HTTP connection 

Enables unidirectional communication, where the server can push updates to the client in real-time 

Utilizes the EventSource API in the client-side JavaScript to establish and handle the connection 

Supports automatic reconnection and event-based messaging 

üåê Long-Lived Unidirectional Communication 

SSE maintains a persistent, long-lived HTTP connection between the client and the server 

The server can send data to the client at any time, without the client needing to make explicit requests 

The communication is unidirectional, meaning the client cannot send data back to the server over the same connection 

üì® Event Stream Format 

SSE uses a simple text-based format to send events from the server to the client 

Each event consists of one or more lines of text, terminated by a double newline (\n\n) 

The format includes the following fields:  

event: Specifies the name of the event (optional) 

data: Contains the actual data payload of the event 

id: Provides a unique identifier for the event (optional) 

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges 

Browser Compatibility: SSE is supported by most modern browsers, but older browsers may not have native support for the EventSource API 

Connection Limit: Browsers may impose limits on the maximum number of simultaneous SSE connections per page or per browser instance 

Connection Timeout: SSE connections can be subject to timeouts if the server doesn't send data for an extended period, requiring reconnection mechanisms 

Background Tab Behavior: Some browsers may throttle or suspend SSE connections when the page is in a background tab, affecting real-time updates 

Resource Utilization: Maintaining a large number of SSE connections can consume server resources, requiring efficient management and scaling strategies 

Load Balancing and Sticky Connections: Ensuring that SSE connections are routed to the same server instance in a load-balanced environment can be challenging 

Proxy and Firewall Compatibility: SSE traffic may be buffered or blocked by some proxies and firewalls, requiring configuration adjustments 

Broadcasting: Sending the same event to multiple clients requires the server to manage and broadcast the event to all connected clients efficiently
