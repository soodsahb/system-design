Client-Request-Server-Response 

Clients (web browsers) send requests to servers for web pages and resources 

Servers process the requests and send back responses containing the requested data 

🏠 IP Addresses 

Unique numerical labels assigned to devices connected to a network 

Used to identify and communicate with devices on the internet 

🌍 DNS (Domain Name System) 

Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses 

Hierarchical and distributed naming system for computers, services, or resources connected to the internet 

🕸️ Central Hubs and Router Connections 

Central hubs act as connection points for multiple devices in a network 

Routers direct data packets between networks, enabling internet connectivity in homes and offices 

🔍 Domain Levels 

Root domain: The highest level in the DNS hierarchy (e.g., ".com", ".org") 

Second-level domain: The domain name directly preceding the root domain (e.g., "example" in "example.com") 

Third-level domain (subdomain): An optional part added before the second-level domain (e.g., "www" in "www.example.com") 

💻 Servers 

Computers that store, process, and deliver web pages and resources to clients 

Types of servers: Web servers, application servers, database servers, mail servers, etc. 

Servers can be physically located in data centers or hosted in the cloud 

Accessed through specific IP addresses or domain names 

🌊 Optical Fiber Networks 

High-speed data transmission using light pulses through thin glass or plastic fibers 

Used for long-distance data transfer, including undersea cables connecting continents 

🌐 ISP (Internet Service Provider) 

Companies that provide internet access to consumers and businesses 

ISP architecture includes network infrastructure, routers, and servers to manage internet connectivity 

📦 Data Packets and Flow 

Data is divided into smaller units called packets for transmission over the internet 

Packets travel from the client to the server and back, following specific network paths 

Browsers support multiple network requests simultaneously; additional requests are queued 

🖥️ Browser Caching and Service Workers 

Browsers check the cache and service workers before making a request to the server 

If a response is found in the cache or service worker, no further call to the server is made 

🤝 Peering Mechanism 

Voluntary interconnection of networks, allowing direct exchange of traffic between ISPs 

Reduces costs and improves performance by keeping traffic local 

🔄 Client-Server Connection (SYN and ACK) 

SYN (Synchronize) and ACK (Acknowledge) are part of the TCP three-way handshake process 

Client sends SYN, server responds with SYN-ACK, client sends ACK to establish a connection 

🔒 DNS Lookup, TCP Handshake, SSL Handshake 

DNS lookup: Resolving domain names to IP addresses 

TCP handshake: Establishing a reliable connection between client and server 

SSL/TLS handshake: Negotiating encryption parameters for secure communication 

🔐 Server Certificate and Data Encryption 

Server sends its digital certificate to the client for authentication 

Client and server negotiate an encryption method and exchange keys 

Data transmitted between client and server is encrypted to ensure security 

🌐 Four Steps in Displaying a Website 

Loading: Fetching resources (HTML, CSS, JS) from the server 

Scripting: Parsing and executing JavaScript code 

Rendering: Constructing the DOM, CSSOM, and render tree 

Painting: Displaying the rendered content on the screen 

📜 Parsing 

HTML parsing: Converting raw HTML into a Document Object Model (DOM) tree 

Render-blocking: External stylesheets and scripts that block rendering until they are loaded and parsed 

Parser-blocking: JavaScript code that interrupts HTML parsing until executed 

🎨 Style Calculation 

Parsing CSS and building the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) 

CSSOM represents the styles applied to the document 

🌿 DOM, CSSOM, and Render Tree 

DOM: Tree-like representation of the HTML document structure 

CSSOM: Tree-like representation of the styles applied to the document 

Render Tree: Combination of the DOM and CSSOM, representing the visual layout of the page 

⚙️ Executing JavaScript 

Loading scripts: Fetching JavaScript files from the server 

Parsing: Reading and understanding the JavaScript code 

Compiling: Converting the parsed code into machine-readable format 

Executing: Running the compiled code 

🖌️ Layouting, Painting, and Compositing 

Layouting: Calculating the position and size of elements based on the render tree 

Painting: Filling in pixels with colors, texts, and images 

Compositing: Combining multiple painted layers into a final image
